# SurviveInDungeon

It's 3D RPG game. You are controlling a barbarian in a Dungeon. You have to survive in dungeon. Enemies will chase you. You have to skill them to survive. Also you can collect some items like hp/mana regen bar or coins. You can upgrade your character's stats on market.

There will be enemies soon. I'm focusing on coding of skill system. You can check step area for next steps.


It's general UI. You have 4 skill and 1 ultimate skill. Also you have a Hp and Mana bar. The character follows where you click with the mouse.

In UI, you can see the skills cooldown and if you dont have enough mana you will see the outofmana logo on your skill.

It's a movement video. You can control your character in any direction you want.

It's a skillbar UI video. Cooldown is too short beacause It's coding process still continues. I'm still doing some tests.
