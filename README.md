# SurviveInDungeon

It's 3D RPG game. You are controlling a barbarian in a Dungeon. You have to survive in dungeon. There will be enemies soon. You have to kill them to survive.
I'm focusing on coding of skill system.


It's general UI. You have 4 skill and 1 ultimate skill. Also you have a Hp and Mana bar.

In UI, you can see the skills cooldown and if you dont have enough mana you will see the outofmana logo on your skill.

It's a movement video. You can control your character in any direction you want.

It's a skillbar UI video. Cooldown is too short beacause It's coding process still continues. I'm still doing some tests.
